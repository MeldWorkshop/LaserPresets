LaserPresets
============

This repository is a list of presets for the epilog helix laser cutter, 50Watt version.


Installation
============

Fork the repository before hand if you plan to make changes. Then clone the repository (your version or this version
if you didn't fork it.) somewhere on your computer. You can then download the presets from epilog's website here and
save them inside the same directory. The ignore file is setup to ignore those presets from epilog so if you want to
save one of the presets in the repo, make sure to change the name to something descriptive.
